A launcher for old ROBLOX that is built from scratch and is currently under development

## Introduction

ReBlox is a offline revival of ROBLOX, with its purpose is to support clients such as 2016E, 2014L, 2019M, etc. This project contains C# and JS code (and requires node for the server)

## Building

Building this application requires:

* Visual Studio 2022 (or 2019, not tested)
* .NET Framework 4.8


## Downloads
You can download the latest stable release in the [Discord server](https://discord.gg/74s7U4Sbef), however you can also download the beta version patches by signing up to be a Beta Tester in the Discord server. Even though this repo will be used for the launcher, it will **NOT** contain the clients, asset packs, maps, and node included in the downloads.

## System Requirements
The application supports Windows 7 and above since it's made with .NET Framework 4.8, but Windows 7 has not been tested.

## Contributing
You can contribute to this project by making a pull request with the changes you want to be on the master branch. You could also make an issue telling us a bug and we may fix it! However, use common sense when writing your pull request and issues, as we may ignore or close them if you are a problem. We also accept bug reports from our Discord server.
